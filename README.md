# COMMUNICATING DATA FINDINGS
## The Dataset

The prosper dataset constitute about 80 variables of about 113,000 applicants or borrowers between 2005 and 2014 who have taken loans from Prosper Lending platform within this period and have either completed, defaulted, charged-off their loans, or are still making payments on loans taken.

Prosper is an American online peer-to-peer lending platform which provide finance to individuals to fund their debt, student loan, business, home improvement amongst 15 other loan categories. These loans are fixed term for periods of 12, 36 and 60 months. Interest rates on these loans range between 5% and 35% depending on some factors. Borrowers/applicants can access loans up to about $35,000.


**Summary of Findings**

1. Loan categories 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 appear to be most popular amongst applicants
2. Loan categories 3, 4 and 5 appear to be most popular amongst investors
3. Prior 2009, prosper applicants had average credit scores between 400 and above 800 with some having incomplete credit scores,
4. After 2009, Prosper adopted a new system of rating applicants based off a custom risk score (prosper score) built, using historical Prosper data. The prosper score ranges between 1 and 10, with 10 being the lowest risk;
5. Based off this score and applicants' credit profiles, prosper estimates loss or return of applicants' loans;
6. nos 4 and 5 are used to grade applicants into AA (best credit), A, B, C, D, E and HR (first time borrowers);
7. These improved applicants' ratings with least credit score of about 600
8. From applicants/borrowers' estimated loss, in_house score and rating, borrowers' monthly income and loan amount, prosper assigns interest rates
9. These rates are fixed for the loan term i.e., 12, 36 and 60 months
10. Applicants/borrowers who default in payment or had their loans charged off are fined (interest rates are not affected)
11. In spite of the improvement in credit ratings, borrowers regardless of high or low ratings do default in their payments
12. Being a home owner or belonging to a group at prosper doesn't guarantee lower interest rates
13. Investors spread their investment across all loan categories regardless of category popularity

**Key Insights for Presentation**

The focus of this investigation is to determine what factors influence interest rates charged borrowers at prosper lending platform. The influence of borrowers' rating and/or credit scores was especially considered. I couldnt establish any direct relationship between borrowers' credit profiles (open credit lines, revolving accounts, inquiries..) and interest rate. This is because of prosper's new rating system which is used to first assign a score to borrowers based on their history and credit profiles. This score is used to estimate potential loss or return on a borrower's loan, depending on this score (and other factors such as loan amount and monthly income), the borrower is rated/graded after which interest rate is assigned. Interest rates are thus, fixed during the loan term and any default in loan payment accrues charges instead.
